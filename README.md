# bigbluebutton-vagrant

Vagrant virtual box environment setup for BigBlueButton 1.0

Download [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), and then run in terminal `vagrant up` to build the image, you may need to choose one from the available bridged network interfaces to finish the network setup. Once the setup is finished, it will print out "Finish setup on http://ipaddr", where `ipaddr` is the ip address of the VM.
